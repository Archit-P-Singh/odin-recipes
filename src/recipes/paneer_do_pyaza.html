    <h1>Paneer Do Pyaza</h1>
    <h2>Basic Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            Paneer do pyaza is a rich, creamy curry of soft succulent paneer and plenty of onions in a wonderful <br>
            medley of spices, herbs and tomatoes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The word “Do” means two or double and “Pyaza” or “Piaza” means onions. This means that the onions are added <br>
            twice in the recipe or double the amount of onions are included.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one more interesting anecdote in relation to this dish. That of Emperor Akbar's courtier, Mullah Do Piyaza<br>
            creating this recipe unexpectedly when he added a huge amount of onions to a meat dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            People who love creamy, mild and less spiced food will love this paneer do pyaza. But as you prefer you can increase <br>
            the spice and heat in the dish by adding some red chili powder or cayenne pepper.Paneer do pyaza can also be served as <br>
            a starter or a side dish with a North Indian meal.

            <p>
                Cover the pan and let the onions and tomatoes blanch in the hot water for about 20 to 25 minutes.
